# 3D Skull Labeling Game - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Initial Setup ‚è≥
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Set up Three.js
- [ ] Import basic skull model
- [x] Implement camera controls

## Phase 2: Label System üìç
- [ ] Create development mode for label placement
- [ ] Implement label rendering system
- [ ] Create data structure for label positions
- [ ] Save/load label position data

## Phase 3: Game Mechanics üéÆ
- [ ] Implement drag and drop interface

- Skull model (.glb/.gltf format)
- CSS3DRenderer for labels
- Drag-and-drop functionality

## Progress Notes

### 2024-02-23
- Created initial project structure
- Set up Three.js environment with:
  - Scene setup
  - Camera controls (OrbitControls)
  - Lighting
  - Window resize handling
  - Basic error handling
- Created placeholder for skull model
- Set up basic UI layout with CSS

### Next Steps
1. Obtain and import a suitable skull 3D model
2. Test basic scene rendering and controls
3. Begin implementing the label placement system
