# 3D Models Directory

This directory should contain the following 3D model file:

- `skull.glb` - A 3D model of a human skull in GLB format

## Model Requirements
- Format: GLB/GLTF
- Reasonable polygon count (optimized for web)
- Proper UV mapping if textures are included
- Centered pivot point
- Clean topology for accurate label placement

## Note
The skull model is not included in the repository. You'll need to:
1. Obtain a suitable 3D skull model
2. Convert it to GLB format if necessary
3. Name it `skull.glb`
4. Place it in this directory
